# WindowApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Then Run `npm run electron` for a dev instance of electron. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build for distribution

Set PACKAGE=true in .env file, then Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
Then Run `npm run electron` to start the app

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Bootstrapping Windows

Prerequisites

Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 or higher
Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 - download VS 2015 Community Edition for free
Python 2.7
Node.js
Git
Debugging Tools for Windows if you plan on creating a full distribution since symstore.exe is used for creating a symbol store from .pdb files.

The bootstrap script will download all necessary build dependencies and create the build project files. Notice that weâ€™re using ninja to build Electron so there is no Visual Studio project generated.

`$ python script\bootstrap.py -v`

## Building Windows

After building is done, you can find electron.exe under out\D (debug target) or under out\R (release target).

`$ python script\build.py`

## 32bit Build Windows

To build for the 32bit target, you need to pass --target_arch=ia32 when running the bootstrap script:

`$ python script\bootstrap.py -v --target_arch=ia32`

## To generate a Visual Studio project, you can pass the --msvs parameter: Windows

`$ python script\bootstrap.py --msvs`

## Cleaning

`$ npm run clean`

`import _ from "lodash";`
`import * as numeral from 'numeral';`
